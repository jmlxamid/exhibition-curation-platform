## Introduction

Welcome to my Exhibition Curation Platform! This web application allows art enthusiasts to create personalized virtual exhibitions by exploring and curating artworks from world-renowned collections including the Rijksmuseum and Harvard Art Museums.

I created this platform to bridge the gap between museum collections and personal curation, bringing the joy of exhibition design to everyone regardless of physical location or access to art institutions.
